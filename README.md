README

"Run UI.java to Start"

This ToDoList opens up an interface that greets the user and requests to add tasks to the interface.
The user will be able to make multiple lists  through the "file" button at the top corner and name them. Once the list is made, using the "edit" button will allow the user to do two actions: add tasks to the lists and add certain tags to it, depending on what the task is needed for. Once a task is completed it can be clicked and it will move into a completed section, every task that is finished and completed will be greyed out and separated from the current on-going tasks. Every file is going to be ordered by date.
Using the "file" button will also allow to save current to do lists that are being worked on in display as files inside your device so they are stored, load previously saved to do lists and close currently open ones. 
The "filters" button will show what tasks have given tags. 
Clicking on the "X" on each tab will close the lists.
